SOURCE CODE STRUCTURE
=====================

The source code is divided into the following directories. Each directory contains a readme documenting
the files or subdirectories in that directory.

* (game)[https://github.com/nothings/shockmac/tree/master/ShockMac/game] - System Shock code
* (Libraries)[https://github.com/nothings/shockmac/tree/master/ShockMac/Libraries] - Shared libraries used by multiple Looking Glass games: graphics, sound, UI, etc.

System Shock GPL Source Code
============================

This is a fork from https://github.com/NightDiveStudios/shockmac, intended for instructional purposes.
It will no longer compile on the Mac, as I have eliminated the metadata files (see discussion
on their page).

At the time of writing the source code copyright apparently now belongs to Night Dive Studios, Incorporated.
